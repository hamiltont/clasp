= Project Setup =

1. Use git to clone project
   
   $ git clone <url>
   $ cd clasp

2. Use maven to generate eclipse files

   $ mvn -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true -DoutputDirectory=target/eclipse-classes eclipse:eclipse
  
   Note: This will download a lot the first time you run it
 
3. Import project into eclipse

   File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace
   Select the clasp directory as the root directory
   Note: If you've cloned the clasp directory inside of your Eclipse workspace, then 'Copy projects into 
   workspace' has to be unchecked. If you've cloned it elsewhere you can either check or leave it 
   unchecked - I would recommend checking it. 
   Select Finish
