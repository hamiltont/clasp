2.1 - Determine how to build entire framework as a single
    jar file. Determine if jar file can be linked into 
    an existing Java code base
4 - Setup doxygen to build documentation for code. 
    Potentially make this one of the BuildHive 
    outputs
5 - Write unit tests for various parts of the system. 
    Lookup scala standard for this e.g. are tests 
    placed in one separate location or placed into 
    their respective classes? g

Implement logging system where nodes collect the logs of their running emulators and expose them for other services
Implement telnet client to enable passing of telnet commands into a running emulator
Locate cross-network client and implement cross-network node launching. Potentially use 
       central hostfile to define nodes and their respective SDK locations. Nodes need to 
       register their connected devices and emulators with a central registry
Implement emulator hibernation
Decide how workspace concept should be organized, where SDKs are located, etc
