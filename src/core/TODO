0 - Setup Eclipse to run scala. I used Eclipse Juno 
    and the integrated software installer (help->
    install new software) to install 
    the Scala IDE from "http://download.scala-ide.org/nightly-update-juno-master-2.10.x"
    and the Scala read eval print loop (REPL) from
    http://scala-ide.dreamhosters.com/nightly-update-worksheet-scalaide21-210/site/
1 - Implement entire Android SDK command line API e.g. 
    have AndroidProxy contain all android commands, 
    EmulatorProxy contain all emulator commands, etc
2 - Construct ToolsFacade so that all android commands
    can be accessed from a common scala object
2.1 - Determine how to build entire framework as a single
    jar file. Determine if jar file can be linked into 
    an existing Java code base
3 - Setup code to build using BuildHive (may require 
    Maven pom file)
4 - Setup doxygen to build documentation for code. 
    Potentially make this one of the BuildHive 
    outputs
5 - Write unit tests for various parts of the system. 
    Lookup scala standard for this e.g. are tests 
    placed in one separate location or placed into 
    their respective classes? g
