1 - Implement entire Android SDK command line API e.g. 
    have AndroidProxy contain all android commands, 
    EmulatorProxy contain all emulator commands, etc
2 - Construct ToolsFacade so that all android commands
    can be accessed from a common scala object
3 - Setup code to build using BuildHive (may require 
    Maven pom file)
4 - Setup doxygen to build documentation for code. 
    Potentially make this one of the BuildHive 
    outputs
5 - Write unit tests for various parts of the system
