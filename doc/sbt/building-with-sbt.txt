Building Clasp with sbt.
------------------------

0. Building Clasp.
------------------
After installing sbt, Clasp can be built with:

    $ sbt assembly

This will compile the sources and include the libraries in a jar file
located at `<Clasp>/target/Clasp-Assembly.jar`.


1. Overview of sbt.
-------------------
"sbt is a build tool for Scala and Java projects that aims to do the
basics well" - http://www.scala-sbt.org/

Build definitions are done mostly in `<Clasp>/build.sbt` and plugin
definitions are contained in `<Clasp>/project/plugins.sbt`.
In general, more configuration can be done in `<Clasp>/project/*.scala`.

Build Definition Documentation
------------------------------
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Basic-Def.html

Plugin Documentation
--------------------
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Extending/Plugins


2. `build.sbt` contents.
------------------------
`build.sbt` starts with information about the project.
Then, a non-default source directory is configured with:

    scalaSource in Compile <<= baseDirectory(_ / "src")

The default source directory root is in `src/main/scala`. See
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Directories.html.

-----------

Next, jars are manually added to the classpath with:

    unmanagedJars in Compile +=
        file("lib/hyperic-sigar-1.6.4/sigar-bin/lib/sigar.jar")

See http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Detailed-Topics/Library-Management.


3. `plugins.sbt` contents.
--------------------------
`plugins.sbt` includes `sbt-assembly`, which is a plugin used for fat jar
creation.
See https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly.

    addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.8.6")
