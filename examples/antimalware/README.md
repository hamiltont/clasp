# Android Antimalware

## About
This is a Scala project (previously a set of shell scripts)
and a sample feature vector collection
application to help automate the training and testing of dynamic machine
learning malware classifiers. Arch Linux is the main testing platform.

## Usage
1. Populate `Training` and `Testing` directories.
2. Set the devices and number of emulators. (TODO: Where?)
3. Run `sbt "run --mode Training"` to start profiling applications
and collecting feature vectors.
4. Feature vectors will be saved to `arff/` and the machine learning
classifiers will be accordingly trained and tested with `arff/weka.sh`

## Feature Vector Collection Application
The feature vector collection application called
Antimalware and is an Eclipse project. See below for a short section
on increasing Eclipse's memory if you are trying to load it in Eclipse.
The collected data is stored on an sdcard on the device.

## Increasing Eclipse's Default Memory
Importing the Antimalware Android project into Eclipse is simple. However,
Eclipse's memory needs to be increased to load the Weka library used.
First, find eclipse.ini in your system.

    $ sudo find / -name 'eclipse.ini'
    /usr/share/eclipse/eclipse.ini 

Then edit it and increase the memory settings:

    $ vim /usr/share/eclipse/eclipse.ini

    [...]
    --launcher.XXMaxPermSize
    2048m
    [...]
    --launcher.defaultAction
    [...]
    -Xms1024m
    -Xmx2028m
    [...]
