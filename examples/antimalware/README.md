# Android Antimalware
Dynamic malware analysis framework for the Android platform.

This consists of 3 applications.
 1. `driver` is a Scala application built atop the `clasp`
    framework and iterates through the applications and
    collects profiling information using `profiler`.
 2. `analyzer` is a Scala application using the `weka` library
    to analyze the data collected by `driver` with machine
    learning algorithms.
 3. `profiler` is an Android application to dynamically
    profile the Android system at runtime.

## Configuration and running.
