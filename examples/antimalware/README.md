# Android Antimalware
Dynamic malware analysis framework for the Android platform.

Antimalware consists of 3 applications.
 1. `driver` is a Scala application built atop the `clasp`
    framework and iterates through the applications and
    collects profiling information using `profiler`.
 2. `analyzer` is a Scala application using the Weka library [1]
    to analyze the data collected by `driver` with machine
    learning algorithms.
 3. `profiler` is an Android application to dynamically
    profile the Android system at runtime.

## Inputs and outputs.
 + __Inputs.__ Antimalware profiles applications from the `apps` directory
   and with the profiling application in `profiler`.
 + __Outputs.__ Feature vectors as Weka ARFF files are output in the
   `arff` directory.

## Configuration and running - Overview.
Documentation for each tool is provided with `-help`.

 1. Configure and run `clasp`.
 2. Populate `apps/benign` and `apps/malicious` with APKs.
 3. Ensure `driver/src/main/resources/application.conf`
    exists and is correct.
 4. Stage and run `driver` to populate the `arff` directory.
 5. Run `profiler` to invoke machine learning algorithms and output
    in the `results` directory.
